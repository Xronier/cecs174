// HW2 detects palindromes that are only alphabetical, meaning any other character is ignored. If no alpha characters exist, it's assumed to

HW2 can also detects crossword squares. Verification of the word(s) is done using the supplied EnglishDictionary.py and words_alpha.txt
written by my instructior.

HW4 named digitalLove.java simply identifies if an inputted number is in increasing order by the digit.
